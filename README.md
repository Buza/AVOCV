#  AVOCV: An AVFoundation-based OpenCV experimentation environment.

![](https://buzamoto.s3.amazonaws.com/acvocv-cap-small.png)

AVOCV was built in order to create an extremely simple and
lightweight OpenCV experimentation environment for
OS X 10.13.x. This is a more modern update to CVOCV, a QTKit + OpenGL
version written in 2008 for OSX 10.5.

## Prerequisites
In contrast to CVOCV, which contained precompiled OpenCV binaries, to use AVOCV, you'll
need to install OpenCV on your mac. 
See [this tutorial](https://blogs.wcode.org/2014/10/howto-install-build-and-use-opencv-macosx-10-10/) as an example.

## Usage

At the heart of AVOCV is the delegate method:

```
public func captureOutput(_ output: AVCaptureOutput, didOutput sampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer, from connection: AVCaptureConnection)
```

in CameraController.swift. This is a callback procedure that is invoked
by AVFoundation to provide direct access to the pixels coming from 
a video input device. To experiment with the existing examples 
offered by AVOCV, simply uncomment one of the lines in the 
captureOutput method.

For example, the line

```
IplImage *resultImage = [OpenCVProcessor cannyTest:frameImage];
```

in captureOutput will create an OpenCV-processed image from the
current input frame, and send the pixels to [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal) to be rendered.

For users that would like to implement their own examples, simply
look at OpenCVProcessor.m for examples.

## Contributions

Contributions in the form of elegant, demonstrative examples are
welcome and encouraged. Contact me if you have something you
think would make a nice addition to this project.
